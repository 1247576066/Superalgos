# Order Fetcher From SA
Ver 0.4 <br>

This program is designed to run in (but doesn't strictly have to) the Superalgos (SA) environment and fetch order data direct from SA's logs. It also formats the data to the same format as Binance's "Order Export" format. This is to allow other programs and services (like Trade Analysis) to produce reports and further analyis on your Order / Trade information.
